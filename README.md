# Bike Sharing Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bike sharing data to gain insights into usage patterns, user behavior, and other key metrics. The analysis was conducted using various data science and machine learning techniques to understand trends and make predictions.

## Project Structure

- **Bike.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
  
## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `statsmodels`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns (modify according to your dataset):

- **Date**
- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Wind Speed**
- **Bike Count**

## Analysis and Modeling

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies in the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, trends, and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that may help improve model performance.
4. **Modeling**: Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict bike usage.
5. **Results and Insights**: Summarizing the findings from the analysis and models.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

    Open `Bike.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and run the cells to execute the analysis.

3. **Review the Results**:

    The notebook includes detailed comments and explanations of each step. Follow along to understand the process and results.
